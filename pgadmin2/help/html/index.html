<b>Copyright (C) 2001, 2002, The <a href="licenceinfo/team.html">pgAdmin Development Team</a><br>
This software is released under the <a href="licenceinfo/licence.html">pgAdmin Public
Licence</a></b>

<p>pgAdmin II is a comprehensive <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL
database</a> design and management system for Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000. It is
freely available under the terms of the <a href="licenceinfo/licence.html">pgAdmin Public
Licence</a> and may be redistributed provided the terms of the licence are
adhered to.</p>
<p>The pgAdmin Website may found at <a href="http://www.pgadmin.org">http://www.pgadmin.org</a>.</p>
<p>pgAdmin II uses the <a href="http://odbc.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL ODBC
Driver (psqlODBC)</a> to communicate with a PostgreSQL server. The software
allows the entire server to be managed by using 'DSN-less' connections that are
made and managed by the pgSchema object library. All PostgreSQL object types are
supported and may be created, dropped and edited to the extent supported by the
database.</p>
<p>This software was written as a successor to the original pgAdmin product,
which though popular, had limitations in the design that prevented it being
taken to the 'next level'. The core of the software (the pgSchema library) has a
fully object-oriented design, and manages all database operations for the main
program, as well as providing a hierarchical object model to represent the
existing objects on the server. Click <a href="developerinfo/index.html">here</a> for more
complete <a href="developerinfo/index.html">technical information</a>.</p>

<p>In order to run install and run pgAdmin II, you will need the following
software pre-installed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL 7.1</a> or higher. This may be installed
  locally (under Cygwin, or in a suitable virtual machine such as <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">
  VMware</a> running Linux, BSD or Solaris). In many cases, PostgreSQL will be
  installed on a remote server.
  pgAdmin II has also been run successfully using <a href="http://www.winehq.org">Wine</a>
  to manage a PostgreSQL installation on the same Linux machine.<br><br></li>
  <li>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/">Windows Installer</a>.
  This is pre-installed on Windows 2000 and ME, but may be required on earlier
  versions of Windows. Unfortunately Microsoft re-organise their website
  regularly so you will need to search for 'windows installer redistributable'
  in order to find the actual downloadable file.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/data">Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC)</a>.
  Unlike it's predecessor, pgAdmin II is not dependent on the latest version of
  MDAC, requiring only version 2.0 or higher. MDAC is pre-installed on most newer
  versions of Windows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the PostgreSQL ODBC driver is <b>not</b> required, as the latest
version ships and installs with pgAdmin II.</p>

<p>pgAdmin II may be downloaded <a href="http://pgadmin.postgresql.org/downloads/">here</a>, and is
supported through the <a href="mailing.html">mailing lists</a>. Please out check
the <a href="troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting Guide</a> as well.</p>

<p>For queries <b>not </b>related to support or development of pgAdmin II, such
as licencing queries, please contact <a href="mailto:dpage@pgadmin.org">Dave
