<b>Copyright (C) 2001, The <a href="licenceinfo/team.html">pgAdmin Development Team</a><br>
This software is released under the <a href="licenceinfo/licence.html">pgAdmin Public 
Licence</a></b>


<p>pgAdmin II is a comprehensive <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL 
database</a> design and management system for Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000. It is 
freely available under the terms of the <a href="licenceinfo/licence.html">pgAdmin Public 
Licence</a> and may be redistributed provided the terms of the licence are 
adhered to.</p>
<p>pgAdmin II uses the <a href="http://odbc.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL ODBC 
Driver (psqlODBC)</a> to communicate with a PostgreSQL server. The software 
allows the entire server to be managed by using 'DSN-less' connections that are 
made and managed by the pgSchema object library. All PostgreSQL object types are 
supported and may be created, dropped and edited to the extent supported by the 
database.</p>
<p>This software was written as a successor to the original pgAdmin product, 
which though popular, had limitations in the design that prevented it being 
taken to the 'next level'. The core of the software (the pgSchema library) has a 
fully object-oriented design, and manages all database operations for the main 
program, as well as providing a hierarchical object model to represent the 
existing objects on the server. Click <a href="developerinfo/index.html">here</a> for more 
complete <a href="developerinfo/index.html">technical information</a>.</p>


<p>In order to run install and run pgAdmin II, you will need the following 
software pre-installed on your PC:</p>


<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/">Windows Installer</a>. 
  This is pre-installed on Windows 2000 and ME, but may be required on earlier 
  versions of Windows. Unfortunately Microsoft re-organise their website 
  regularly so you will need to search for 'windows installer redistributable' 
  in order to find the actual downloadable file.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/data">Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC)</a>. 
  Unlike it's predecessor, pgAdmin II is not dependent on the latest version of 
  MDAC requiring version 2.0 or higher. MDAC is pre-installed on most newer 
  versions of Windows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the PostgreSQL ODBC driver is <b>not</b> required, as the latest 
version ships and installs with pgAdmin II.</p>


<p>pgAdmin II may be downloaded <a href="download.html">here</a>, and is 
supported through the <a href="mailing.html">mailing lists</a>. </p>
