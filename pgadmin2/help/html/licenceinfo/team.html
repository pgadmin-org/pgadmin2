  <ol>

    <li><h5>Purpose</h5>
    The pgAdmin Development Team exists for 2 reasons:<br><br>
    <ol>
      <li> To manage and maintain the pgAdmin Project
      <li> To ensure that pgAdmin remains freely available to anyone that wants it, but 
           to prevent non-standard distribution or rebadging by hostile or predatory 
           commercial companies.
    </ol><br>
  
    <li><h5>Structure</h5>
    The foundation consists of the Project Leader, core developers and members.<br><br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Project Leader</b>: The Project Leader is Dave Page, founder and primary developer 
          of the software. The Project Leader is also considered a Core Developer.
      <li><b>Core Developers</b>: The Core Developers are Members of the Team that in the 
          opinion of the Project Leader have made significant contributions to the Project.
      <li><b>Members</b>: Members can be any contributor to the project who accepts an 
          invitation from the Core Developers.
    </ul><br>

    <li><h5>Division of Responsibilities</h5>
    Any major decision regarding the Project must be voted on by the Core 
    Developers. This would include, but is not limited to the granting of permission 
    to a Commercial Company to rebadge or redistribute the Project or any part 
    thereof in a non-standard form. Any vote will be made via email through the
