<p><b>Functionality - </b>These are priority items that are easily possible through SQL.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add support for OPERATOR CLASSes<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Add support for CONVERSIONs<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Add support for CASTs<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Give user the option to reclaim disk space (i.e. UPDATE table SET col = col; VACUUM FULL table) when dropping columns.<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Allow the addition of foreign keys to an existing table.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Essential Enhancements</b> - These are items that should be considered important, but are not necessarily easy, or even possible.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use cursors/on demand loading in the Datagrid with large recordsets.<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Auto generate rules on views to allow updating of views.<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Allow selection of the .mdw file in the Migration Wizard.<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Allow Migration of data only to pre-existing tables in the Migration Wizard.<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Data editor should recognise multi-column primary keys<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Publishing Wizard should remember production databases.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Allow use of Views in the SQL Wizard.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Add Frank Lupo's ImgComboEx code to allow auto-complete in image combo 
  boxes.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Modify the HighlightBox to detach into a self contained mini editor.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Add a definable row limit to 'View Data' queries.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Miscellaneous</b> - These are potentially large projects, that may not be widely used. These are low priority.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add 'Projects' support. Should allow objects to be grouped into projects. 
  A single project should be exportable to an SQL script, or publishable to 
  other databases/servers. Should also include security to restrict access to 
  objects to authorised development team members.<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Build a Log Analyser Plugin to analyse PostgreSQL logs. eg. Watching a 
  user's session, diagnosing errors, possibly generating roll-back data, 
  watching for transaction processing &quot;hot-spots&quot; during a day or week, etc.<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Build an entity relationship diagramming plugin. This should reverse 
  engineer the database to build a user updateable ER diagram of a database.<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Add statistics reports for 7.2. Output should be HTML(?) - Crystal Reports should *not* be used.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Allow connections to multiple servers simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
