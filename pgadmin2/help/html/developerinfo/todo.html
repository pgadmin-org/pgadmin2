<ul>
  <li>Add 'Projects' support. Should allow objects to be grouped into projects. 
  A single project should be exportable to an SQL script, or publishable to 
  other databases/servers. Should also include security to restrict access to 
  objects to authorised development team members.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Add code to allow pseudo-editing of Views, Triggers, Functions &amp; Tables. 
  This would be implemented in pgSchema and would generally involve dropping 
  object and re-creating them with the new changes applied.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Build a Log Analyser Plugin to analyse PostgreSQL logs. eg. Watching a 
  user's session, diagnosing errors, possibly generating roll-back data, 
  watching for transaction processing &quot;hot-spots&quot; during a day or week, etc.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Build an entity relationship diagramming plugin. This should reverse 
  engineer the database to build a user updateable ER diagram of a database.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Add a Plugin to drive erServer.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Write PostgreSQL Installer for Cygwin PostgreSQL. This should run from 
  pgAdmin and auto download &amp; install Cygipc, a minimal Cygwin and PostgreSQL.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Use cursors/on demand loading in the Datagrid with large recordsets.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Allow creation/viewing of Triggers and Rules on Views.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Auto generate rules on views to allow updating of views.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Add support for Unicode charactersets (UTF-8/16).<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Allow dropping of UNIQUE & PRIMARY contraints by dropping the relevant index.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Add statistics reports for 7.2. Output should be HTML(?) - Crystal Reports should *not* be used.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Add support for dropping of CHECK constraints.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Only connect to each database when accessed, not when Databases node is clicked.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Add Context sensitivity to the Create menu/button.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Allow selection of the .mdw file in the Migration Wizard.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Allow Migration of data only to pre-existing tables in the Migration Wizard.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
