<p>
<b>What are MD5 Encrypted Passwords?</b><br><br>
Versions of PostgreSQL prior to 7.2 stored passwords in the pg_shadow system 
table in plain text. Despite the fact that only superusers can read this table, 
this is still considered insecure, and so an enhancement to PostgreSQL was 
written that allowed passwords to optionally be stored in MD5 encrypted format.</p>

<p>
pgAdmin defaults to using encrypted passwords with PostgreSQL 7.2 and above. 
This behaviour can be changed under Tools -&gt; Options.</p>

<p>
<b>Why can't my applications connect now?</b></p>

<p>
There are two reasons why applications may not work with encrypted passwords:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The client applications must support encrypted passwords. For an ODBC 
  based application, this requires that the psqlODBC driver v07.01.0009 or 
  higher is used. libpq applications should be linked to libpq from PostgreSQL 
  7.2 or higher.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>$PGDATA/pg_hba.conf must be updated. The simplest method is to just change 
  those of type 'password' to type 'md5'.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Where can I read more about this?</b></p>
<p>More information can be found in the PostgreSQL Administrators guide
<a href="../postgresql/client-authentication.html">here</a>, and under the 
CREATE USER entry in the Reference guide,
<a href="../postgresql/sql-createuser.html">here</a>.</p>
