<b>The Database Migration Wizard</b><br><br>
The pgAdmin Database Migration Wizard is a pgAdmin II type 1 plugin that is distributed seperately from 
pgAdmin. Primarily, this is because it is based heavily on code from the original pgAdmin project and 
is released under the GNU General Public Licence.<br><br>
The wizard will migrate tables, data &amp; indexes from an ODBC datasource, and can also directly connect 
to Microsoft Access databases using the Microsoft Jet Engine (you may need to download this from 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/data">http://www.microsoft.com/data</a>). When used in this mode, foreign 
keys may also be migrated.<br><br>
The Database Migration Wizard has been successfully tested by the author with Microsoft Access & MySQL. There
have been reports of successful use with Oracle, Informix and Microsoft SQL server. We'd appreciate it if you
could report you successes or failures, even with Access or MySQL - just add an Interactive Documentation Note
to the copy of this page on the pgAdmin Website - <a href=http://www.pgadmin.org">http://www.pgadmin.org</a> - 
you'll find it under the How do I... section.
</p>

<p>
<b>Installation</b><br>
<ol>
  <li>Download the plugin from <a href="http://www.pgadmin.org/">http://www.pgadmin.org/</a>.</li><br>&nbsp;
  <li>Extract the .dll file from the zip archive using Winzip, and save it in your pgAdmin plugins folder
      (normally this is C:\Program Files\pgAdmin2\Plugins).</li><br>&nbsp;
  <li>Click Start -> Run</li><br>&nbsp;
  <li>In the Open: textbox, enter the following command:<br><br>
      <i>regsvr32 "C:\Program Files\pgAdmin2\Plugins\pgMigration.dll"</i><br><br>
      You may need to alter the path to the dll file on your system.</li><br>&nbsp;
  <li>Click OK, and you should see a message box indicating success. The Migration Wizard 
      should now appear on the Plugins menu in pgAdmin when you next start it, and connect to 
      a server.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<b>The Migration Process</b><br><br>
The Migration Wizard tries to make the process as simple as possible - here are the basic steps involved:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Start pgAdmin, and connect to your target server.</li><br>&nbsp;
  <li>From the Plugins menu, select the 'Database Migration Wizard'.</li><br>&nbsp;
  <li>The first step in the wizard requires you to specify your source database, and set a few options. Select whether you are migrating an ODBC, Access or SQL Server database using the radio buttons at the top, and 
      the relevant connection options will be displayed. Enter the required details to connect to the source database.</li><br>&nbsp;
  <li>Select any additional options. These pretty much explain themselves:<br>&nbsp;
      <ul>
        <li>Create columns as 'NOT NULL' where applicable</li>
        <li>Create Indexes on Migrated Tables</li>
        <li>Create Primary Keys on Migrated Tables</li>
        <li>Convert Table Names to Lower Case</li>
        <li>Convert Column Names to Lower Case</li>
        <li>Convert Index/Key Names to Lower Case</li>
      </ul></li><br>      
  <li>Click 'Next'!</li><br>&nbsp;
  <li>Select the database on the target PostgreSQL server that you wish to migrate to.</li><br>&nbsp;
  <li>Click 'Next'!</li><br>&nbsp;
  <li>Select the tables in the source database that you wish to migrate.</li><br>&nbsp;
  <li>Click 'Next'!</li><br>&nbsp;
  <li>In this step, you can select the tables that you wish to migrate data from. Note that binary or 
      BLOB data will be skipped.</li><br>&nbsp;
  <li>Click 'Next' (again)!</li><br>&nbsp;
  <li>If you are migrating an Access or SQL Server database using the OLEDB interface (rather than an ODBC datasource) this step will
      allow you to select the Foreign Keys to migrate. The migration process will attempt to figure out
      the proper dependency order from the selected keys and will migrate the tables in the required order.
      Note that it is possible for data to exist in an Access database that doesn't meet the requirements
      of the Foreign Key - such data will cause the migration to fail.</li><br>&nbsp;
  <li>Click 'Next' (last time)!</li><br>&nbsp;
  <li>You will now be presented with the migration log window. This will display any messages during the
      migration process. Just click the 'Migrate db' button to start the process and kick back with a coffee!
      </li>      
</ol>
</p>         

<p>
<b>Type Mapping</b><br><br>
The datatypes of columns in the souce database are identified to the Migration Wizard as Microsoft ADO
datatypes. These types can be mapped as required to a PostgreSQL type at any time before the migration
process is started by clicking the 'Type Map' button. Any changes you make to the Type Map will be
remembered as the default settings for your next migration.<br><br>
For most people, the default settings should work fine.
</p>

<p>
<b>Troubleshooting</b><br><br>
If an error occurs during migration, the entire run will be rolled back to ensure that the target database
is not left in an unknown state.<br><br>
The majority of errors are caused by invalid type mappings, such as mapping
adVarChar to int4.<br><br>
Other errors may be harder to track down and may be caused by a data type or format that the wizard can't 
correctly handle, or a quirk of the source database or it's ODBC driver. In these cases, it's often beneficial
to switch the 'Log Level' to 'Debug' on the 'Options' dialogue box in pgAdmin. You will need to re-connect to
the target database after making this change. This will ensure that an ODBC driver log is created (usually 
C:\psqlodbc_nnnn.log), and that the pgAdmin log (usually C:\pgAdmin II_nnnn.log) contains all the SQL queries
that are being executed on the PostgreSQL server. The pgAdmin log in particular can show why the migration
has failed.
<br><br>If you cannot solve your problem, yourself then post the <b>relevant</b> sections of your logfiles
to the <a href="mailto:pgadmin-support@postgresql.org">pgadmin-support@postgresql.org</a> mailling list along
with a description of what went wrong.
</p>

<p>
<b>Warning:</b> Make sure you thoroughly check and sample test data in any migrated database as the migration 
process is not infallible - in particular, binary data is often skipped altogether though you are warned when 
this happens. Make sure you take a backup in case something goes wrong! No author of pgAdmin, whether part of 
the <a href="../licenceinfo/team.html">Development Team</a> or not can be held responsible for any loss or 
corruption of data.
